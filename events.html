                <h2>Java Programming at Northview</h2>
                <p>Java is a programming environment built by Oracle, with open source alternatives avilable as well. At Northview, you will learn how to program in java during your Junior Year. I will personally say that learning java is an important skill as it promotes learning object inhertiance, alongside object-oriented programming. Java skills will also easily transfer over to the C programming language as it is very similar, and object oriented as well.</p>
